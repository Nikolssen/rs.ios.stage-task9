Two droids carrying plans to the Death Star — the Empire’s superweapon — crash-land on Tatooine, where Vader’s son, Luke, lives. Luke, thinking his father was a hero who died in the Clone Wars, joins up with Obi-Wan and two space mercenaries named Han Solo and Chewbacca to return the plans to a princess, Leia, leading the Rebellion. Obi-Wan teaches Luke the ways of the Jedi, then dies fighting Vader. Luke joins the Rebellion and destroys the Death Star with Han’s help.

Luke continues his training with Yoda, who was in hiding, at the request of Obi-Wan’s ghost. After a climactic fight that sees Han captured and possibly killed, Luke learns Vader is his father and Leia is actually his sister.

Luke returns to Tatooine to retrieve Han’s frozen body. Han and Leia join back up with the Rebellion while Luke confronts his father and Palpatine after ostensibly becoming an autodidact Jedi following Yoda’s death. The Rebellion destroys a second Death Star while Luke and Vader duel. Rather than kill Luke, Vader double-crosses the Emperor, killing him and getting mortally wounded in the process. Luke cremates his father’s body on a pyre during a celebration of the Empire’s defeat. Freedom is restored to the galaxy, or is it?
